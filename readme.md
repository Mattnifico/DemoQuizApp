# Quiz App Demo

## What is this?

This demo showcases the framework for a quiz app, showing off how a quiz would work with the given code. The user presses the start button and begins answering some questions, while being told after they've selected an answer if it is right or wrong. The user is then given a final score and the option to take the quiz again.

## How does it work?

This demo has a lot of functional features, including:

- A button that awaits user input to start the quiz
- An interactive display for each question
  - A variety of answers for each question with visual indicators that let the user know if they selected the correct one
  - A timer that counts down to zero, shutting off all user interaction with the answers after this occurs. This timer also stops once a user selects an answer
  - A counter letting the user know how many questions they've answered as well as the total amount of questions
  - Another button allowing the user to continue to the next question
  - A quiz completion screen that gives the user multiple options, either to replay the quiz or go back to the starting page
